# Test Bed Tool

The TestBed is a tool which can execute the JUnit test cases scope to test the android devices. 
The tool includes almost all the executables and resources to run, 
so you can avoid setting up extra tools to fit your environment.

You donâ€™t need to take much time to consider the java 
or other tool versions (like gradle) to run each test case.
